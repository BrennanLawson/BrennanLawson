- 👋 Hi, I’m @BrennanLawson
- 👀 I’m interested in software design, especially for messy, human problems which require a lot of flexibility 
- 🌱 I’m currently leveling up my Python skills, making portfolio pieces, and seeking remote developer positions, either freelance or salaried
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project that features a modular interface
